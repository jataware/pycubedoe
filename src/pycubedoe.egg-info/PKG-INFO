Description: # pycubedoe
        
        ## Description
        
        pycubedoe generates a design of experiments (DOE) by constructing a Nearly Orthogonal Latin Hypercube (NOLH) with user-defined factors and appropriate factor levels. The underling space-filling matrices are provided by the NOLHDesigns_v6.xls: Generating nearly orthogonal Latin Hypercube designs. More information on the NOLHDesigns can be found at: https://nps.edu/web/seed/software-downloads.
        
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        1. Install the pycubedoe package to your environment: 
        
            `pip3 install pycubedoe`
        
        
        2. Import the package:
        
            `import pycubedoe as pc`
        
        
        3. Create a dictionary of your desired factors and their associated levels. pycubedoe can support both numeric and categorical factor-types. For each factor-type, build a dictionary as described below:
        
            **In general**:
        
            - For numeric factors:     {"factor name": [min Value, max Value, number of desired decimal places],...}
           
            - For categorical factors: {"factor name": ["list", "of", "categorical", "levels"],...}
        
           **Example Parameter Dictionaries**:
        
           - **Numeric Factors Only Dictionary**:
        
             `numeric = {"a":[1,5,2],...}`
        
             where `a` is the factor label and the list is: 
             
             `[<min factor value = 1>, <max factor value = 5>, <number of significant digits = 2>]`
        
        
           - **Categorical Factors Only Dictionary**:
        
             `categorical = {"flag": ["red", "white", "blue"],...}`
        
              where `flag` is the factor label and the list is: 
            
             `["a", list", "of", "all", categorical", "levels"]`
        
        
           - **Both Numeric and Categorical Factors, as seen above**:
        
             `numeric = {"a":[1,5,2],...}`
        
             `categorical = {"flag": ["red", "white", "blue"],...}`
        
        
        
        4. Build the Design of Experiments (DOE):
        
           - Default: `pc.pycubeDOE(numeric = None, categorical = None)`
           
           - Assign your pre-built factor-type dictionaries:
           
              `DOE = pc.pycubeDOE(numeric = numeric, categorical = categorical)`
        
           - This function returns a pandas dataframe with user-defined factors and factor-values within a user-defined range.
        
             - Each column is a user-defined factor; either numeric or categorical.
             - Each row is a design point.
             - In aggregate, all design points form a Nearly-Orthogonal Latin Hypercube that efficiently explores the parameter space while reducing the computational load.
        
             **NOTE**: for factor-types *not* used, you must assign it a value of `None`. 
           
               For example: `DOE = pc.pycubeDOE(numeric = None, categorical = categorical)`   
        
        5. There is a helper function `pc.designPoints(DOE)` that iterates over each design point (row) of your DOE dataframe. First you will need to assign each design point value to a factor name. Below is an example using `exampleRun` as the model:
        
        
        ```
        def exampleRun(designPT):
            #Assign your variable values from the DOE design point
            a = designPT[0]
            flag = designPT[1]
            ### DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR DESIGN POINT, for example:
            if flag == "red" and a <= 2.5:
                return round(a*a,2)
            else:
                return 0
        ```
        
          Then run the design points over `exampleRun` where we call pycubedoe's `pc.designPoints` function:
        
        ```
        modelResults = []
        for designPT in pc.designPoints(DOE):
            sim = exampleRun(designPT)
            modelResults.append(sim)
        print(modelResults) 
        ```
        
        ## Acknowledgments
        The full designs for up to 22 factors are from Tom Cioppa's 2002 PhD dissertation (2002).  For ease of application, we use a slightly different column order for designs with fewer factors.  The 29-factor design was provided by Andy Hernandez.  For more details about the properties or application of these designs, see
